Seya
===============================

Bringing up some extra Cosmo to Keras.

* Free software: BSD license
* Documentation: https://seya.readthedocs.org.

Note: This code base was built with Keras 0.3. There is a branch called `keras1` where some of the layers were updated to work 
with the new API. To makes things easier to maintain, I'll start publishing individual models as self-contained github
repositories and cross-reference them here. 

Why Seya?
---------
Those smart guys may know a lot about ancient greek mathematicians and poetry.
But the first thing I remember about Greece is my childhood favorite anime, Saint Seiya.
I misspelled it as Seya and now the name is 1/5 shorter.

Features
--------

* Spatial Transformer Networks example
* Recursive graph WIP_
* Sparse coding
* Bidirectional RNN example_
* DRAW_
* `Neural Turing Machines`_
